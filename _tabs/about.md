Hi, my name is Edson!

I have been working in IT since 2012, including technical support, software development, and, most recently, as a Site Reliability Engineer.

As a DevOps Engineer and SRE, I have gained valuable experience in various initiatives such as migration to AWS services (including ECS and EKS), optimizing cloud service costs, and managing infrastructure using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform.
